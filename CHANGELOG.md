## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Five Microsoft Agent Framework agents (analyst, commentator, personalization producer, translator, editor)
  with structured Pydantic outputs.
- Five personas (Analyst, Casual Fan, Superfan, Player Tracker, Newcomer) with distinct voice, vocabulary,
  word budget, statistical focus, relevance rules, and overlay style.
- Numeric grounding check with an evidence ledger for analyst tool results.
- Resilient agent runner with timeout, self-correcting retry, and deterministic template fallbacks.
- Analyst statistics tools and environment-driven model client adapter (Ollama locally, Foundry in deployment).

- Streaming match analyzer (stage 2) combining xG, pass difficulty, running player/team statistics,
  possession share, rolling momentum/control/chaos, and rule-based key moment detection.
- Explainable pass difficulty rating with per-factor breakdown.
- Key moments with importance scores and structured facts: goals, big chances, great saves, speed alerts,
  difficult passes, momentum swings, chaos spells, and milestones.
- Synthetic match engine: seeded possession-chain simulator producing full 90-minute event streams
  (passes, carries, shots, goals, saves, pressure, tackles, interceptions, fouls, possession changes).
- Fictional club presets with distinct tactical styles that adapt to game state and fatigue.
- Immutable, JSON-serialisable domain models for matches, teams, players, and events.
- Test suite covering geometry, probability models, roster generation, and statistical realism.
- Repository scaffolding: README, changelog, license, and ignore rules.

### Changed

- Recalibrated simulator tackle and scoring rates toward realistic top-flight averages.
